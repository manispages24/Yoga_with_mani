<p>Welcome to Yoga with Imani! 
     As a certified yoga instructor, I specialize in teaching various forms of yoga <br>
    that promote relaxation and meditation. Whether you're looking to unwind after a long day or simply <br>
     want to take some time for yourself, my classes in Yin Yoga, Gentle Yoga, and Chair Yoga are designed to <br>
     help you achieve a state of calm and clarity. With a focus on slow, mindful movements and deep breathing techniques, <br>
     my classes will allow you to release tension and find balance both physically and mentally. <br>
    Join me on the mat and discover the transformative power of yoga for yourself. </p>
